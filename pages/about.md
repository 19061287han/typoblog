Typozine is an analytical space for discussion on typographic design choices in popular contemporary magazines, both print and digital.

Our banner affixes the popular branding of magazines together in order to illustrate a theme of conjunction in terms of brand ideals and design ideas. Magazines used include Vogue, Time, oh comely, Glamour, The New Yorker, etc. in order to encompass a variety of magazines with different genres, demographics and geographical circulations. Our logo replicates the collage-like design in an abbreviated version to illustrate a magazine clipping style and suggest a theme of creativity and innovation - joining the design elements of seemingly different brands together. The banner design sits atop a collection of magazines with a lowered opacity in order to imply variety and difference with all the different magazine covers denoted, yet also synergy between the individual magazine brands and ours.

Typozine utilises a thematic palette of reds and bright, bold colours to simulate that of a striking gossip magazine; with the red connoting the garish nature of the news presented in such magazines. The intention was to be flashy and eye-catching like that of a newsstand in a supermarket or out on the street, which needs to reel you in with its audacity before the branding specificities are considered. Yet also, to have its own identity in magazine analysis without being too fixated on the branding of one particular magazine example.Â 

Typefaces used within Typozine are sans serif and thin in width to replicate fashion and lifestyle magazines; taking inspiration from brands utilised within the logo/banner imagery. The choice to use fonts similar to luxury branded magazines as opposed to gossip, sports, political, etc, was so to come across as sophisticated and trustworthy.
