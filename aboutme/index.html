<h2>Who am i?</h2>
<p>I am a student, studying my second year of Media, Journalism and Publishing at Oxford Brookes University; aged nineteen; from the Surrey and Hampshire area; currently living in Cowley, Oxford with friends I made in first year university during the lockdown of 2020.
</p>

<div class="info">
  <h2>What do i like?</h2>
  <p>I enjoy reading fiction - with my favourite genres being historcial and fantasy. As well as literature, I journal in my spare time and take part in peaceful climate change protests. I am a vegetarian/vegan but would label myself as plant based to avoid the stigma that comes with the vegan community.
 </p>
   <p>I chose to base my typographic blog on magazine publications because I enjoy reading them myself, currently I am enjoying reading mslexia online.

    <h2>What do i want to do?</h2>
    <p>Ideally, I would be living abroad in Europe, writing for an independant magazine publication about culture and lifestyle. Utilising my university degree to scope out exciting career opportunities in the media landscape. 
      <p>Realistically, I want to work freelance as a writer for indie publications in the UK, online and print, to build my portfolio of published work - to move towards obtaining my idealistic path of work.</p>
