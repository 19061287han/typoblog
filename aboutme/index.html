   <h4>WHO AM I?</h4> 

   <p>Hannah is a student, aged nineteen; studying her second year of Media, Journalism and Publishing at Oxford Brookes University; originally from the Surrey and Hampshire area; currently living in Cowley, Oxford. 
  </p>
 
    <h4>WHAT DO I LIKE?</h4>

    <p>I enjoy reading fiction - with my favourite genres being historcial and fantasy. As well as literature, I journal in my spare time and take part in peaceful climate change protests. I am a vegetarian/vegan but would label myself as plant based to avoid the stigma that comes with the vegan community. I chose to base my typographic blog on magazine publications because I enjoy reading them myself, currently I am enjoying reading Mslexia online. Ideally, in the future I would be living abroad in Europe, writing for an independant magazine publication about culture and lifestyle. Utilising my university degree to scope out exciting career opportunities in the media landscape.  Realistically, I want to work freelance as a writer for indie publications in the UK, online and print, to build my portfolio of published work - to move towards obtaining my idealistic path of work.</p>
