Children’s magazines are a time machine of nostalgia for older generations and they continue to thrive now, even with the ever-developing iPad and tablet generations of kids. As a young child the incentive of brightly coloured flip books of creativity was enticing to say the least. 

Thematically, children’s magazines prove to be heavily colourful and almost chaotic in their layout choices, with an abundance of overlapping sections and foreground sticker icons and action symbols - i.e. speech bubbles and exciting shape boarders. This abundance of disarray is what adheres to the gratifications of the young demographic - they are less likely to want an informational magazine and instead are on the look out for magazines with entertainment purposes. There tends to be less of a cohesive colour scheme with children’s magazines as it is unlikely that the readers are to be critical of the thematics of the publication than say their parents would be. This means that colour is utilised in a different way to that of magazines for older generations; it is instead used as an eye-catcher for those with a shorter attention span. 

When it comes to colour schemes for children’s magazines it can go one of two ways: 

1. Bright and disordered in order to catch the eye of children who (even when young) have the ability to associate bold colours with simple emotions of joy and creativity. 

2. Themed and simple in order to be straight forward to understand at a young age, i.e. stereotypical gendered colours used on “gendered” magazines.

There is an obvious issue that arises with the second option in that simplicity may not gratify a child’s mind and so they won’t gravitate towards that publication. Also by introducing so-called  gendered colours at a young age, it reinforces the gender stereotypes that come with them - which as a society we want to move past - as the youngest levels of development in a child’s mind is where their ideals and mentality starts to shape. 

The typefaces used within children’s publications have to engage the audience enough for them to pick your magazine out of all the options given to them. Publications such as \[one] and \[two] utilise typefaces in the mastheads that are positioned over a third of the cover space in order to force their branding. The simpler the typeface used, the easier it will be for a child to understand and be able to read it. Therefore, sans serif and bold fonts are repeatedly used to convey the contents; especially if the target audience is 4-7 years old when they have only just started learning how to read on their own. The use of serifs on typefaces may confuse or overwhelm the mind of a young child who has only just started to read.

Additionally, when it comes to text on the cover of a child’s publication, there is a lack of cover lines per se and more so the use of buzz words that hint to the contents - relying on children’s association skills of certain words and branding, i.e. the word ‘football!’ instead of a cover line on the specifics of the sport, or if it is a youth sports magazine then maybe simply utilising a footballers name like ‘Messi’ would have the same affect on a child as an informational cover line would on an adult reading a sports magazine. 

In the case of actors and models as the focal imagery on the cover, they might not have the same reception with younger people than they do with older demographics with perhaps obsessive hobbies. Therefore, the use of tv characters and illustrated mascots is essential for engagement with young people. The star appeal that engrosses the young demographics is down to the branding of the products being advertised, meaning that ‘knock off’ mascots may not have as much of a gratification as it doesn’t have as familiar an association. The device of star appeal also links to the use of toys as incentives in magazine pockets. They prove to be an ingenious way of enticing the demographic, especially if paired with buzz words like ‘free’ and ‘toy’ in bold sans serif typefaces plastered on the sleeve. The symbiotic relationship between the toys or freebies and the magazine itself employs the child as a tool of consumerism.
