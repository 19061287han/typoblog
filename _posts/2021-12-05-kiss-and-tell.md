**Celebrity and gossip magazines make up a large percentage of women’s magazines consumed by the public, with not much typographic difference between each different publication when looking at them as a whole.** 

#### Colour

Mainstream celebrity magazines prove to attract their target psychographics by positioning their covers in abundance - a mismatch of colours, that don’t traditionally feature, pairing together to create a busy atmosphere of sensationalism. Colour is essential in the attraction of a gossip-orientated audience; the use of primary colours like bright reds and yellows, mimics that of tabloid newspapers by imitating the immediate buzz of information - with bright colours connoting scandal and hearsay. 

There isn’t really such aa thing as niche celebrity magazines due to the overt positioning of the gossip industry as part of the public sphere, with it making up a large proportion of popular women’s interest and lifestyle magazine sales. 



#### Typography

Buzz words and punchy taglines. The covers of celebrity gossip magazines is where such elements are prominently featured in order to illustrate the correct theme to the audience. Sans serif, thick typefaces are utilised in large font sizes for mastheads and headlines in order to contrast from the heavy imagery of the gossip theme; as are tall, bold typefaces like Futura and Helvetica Neue which both have a heavy weight and condensed width - which feature mostly in headlines and stand firsts. The condensed width fonts are used to illustrate quotes and subheadings mostly in order to stand out in smaller spaces on the cover, allowing for imagery to be seen beneath the text. 

Fonts are boxed and take up a lot of space on covers as with gossip publications the text is the dominant signifier of the theme, with words in general having connotation of rumours and word-of-mouth spreading, linking to the psychographic interests of the audience. 



#### Composition

Typically the conventions of a celebrity news magazine need to convey abundance, therefore the composition must parallel this by offering no opportunity for white space. All elements overlap in a cohesive way in order to omit scarcity of space. Headlines are connected to stand firsts or quotes which have associated images; this interconnectedness creates a chaotic atmosphere of gossip, yet still allows for an easy-to-read cover with each story following a compositional pattern around the focal story - conventionally taking up the largest section of the cover. 

Articles are positioned in either skyscraper or banner sections of similar overall themes to provide ease access for the audience. This differs from the usual outer rim positioning of any other genre of publication. Elements will almost always be covering the masthead or other sections with images popping out of conventional borders  because for gossip magazines the branding is apparent though the abundant composition as opposed to the title of the publication. Unlike with lifestyle magazines for example which all have similar themes but completely different front cover styles in their positioning of bylines and imagery. 



#### Imagery

As suggested by the name, celebrity magazines rely on star appeal with their imagery in order to draw in the accurate gossip interested demographic on the cover, there is usually one main mid shot paparazzi style/candid or photoshoot image relating to the main story of the issue. This photo generally speaking takes up about 50% of the cover space and is positioned in the centre spaces of the cover if split up into the rule of thirds. There will be a dominant byline attached to the imagery which will also take up quite a substantial amount of space. 

All other imagery will relate to their own story while making up part of the background composition and will usually protrude from their assigned sections to again suggest a constant abundance of celebrity news.
